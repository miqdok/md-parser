# MD Parser

This is a **sample markdown document** to test my parser.

## Features

The parser supports:

- **Bold text** using double asterisks
- *Italic text* using single asterisks
- ***Bold and italic*** using triple asterisks
- Lists (both ordered and unordered)

### List Example

Unordered list:

- First point
- Second point
- Third point with *italic* text

Ordered list:

1. First point
2. Second point
3. Third point with **bold** text

## Conclusion

This demonstrates the *basic* markdown features supported by my parser
